## Approach taken

I wanted to make a single page shoe collection screen where a user could scroll their collection with ease as well as adding new sneakers to their collection. 

I started by creating my rails api for my shoe database. I wanted the main user to add shoes to their collection with images, the shoe name,brand and year of release. Once my routes/model were created and working in Postman. Created my front end with React and linked to shoes API in Ruby.

My approach from here was simple, I wanted my shoes collection be appear on the page with React BootStrap Cards. Added a Carasoul to show off some rare sneakers at the top followed by the "add new kicks?" form.
